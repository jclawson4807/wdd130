                <p>I am a child of God, a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and disciple of Jesus Christ.  My wife and I have three children, and are preparing to serve a mission together.  I remember when the missionaries came to teach my family a more correct understanding of Jesus Christ and the restoration of His church and kingdom upon the Earth.  My parents had sought for the true Church of Jesus Christ.  They had spent time reading the Bible, trying to identify the attributes and teachings of Jesus Christ's church during His mortal ministry, and had prayerfully sought to find a church that taught that same doctrine.  I some memory of their baptism, and remember being sealed to them in the Oakland California Temple.  My wife and I were married for time and all eternity in the Bountiful Utah Temple.  Marrying her was the single best decision I ever made.  Our marriage has brought me indescribable joy.  My older son married his sweet wife in the Saratoga Springs Temple in May of 2024.</p>

                <p>Wisconsin is a very beautiful state.  We are frequently blessed with rain, and thus the plantlife here is often a deep, rich green.  Most of the people we meet here are very friendly.  During the October 2024 General Conference, President Nelson announced that a temple would be built in Milwaukee!</p>
