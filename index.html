            <p>Wisconsin is a beautiful state.  We are frequently blessed with rain, and thus the plantlife here is often a deep, rich green.  Most of the people we meet here are very friendly.  During the October 2024 General Conference, President Nelson announced that a temple would be built in Milwaukee!</p>
